Idea Collector
==============


Say you just had a new idea for a project you think would be cool.
The script below will ask you some hard questions so that you can jot down your idea quickly.
Don't worry about me stealing your ideas: everything is saved to ``localStorage``.


Usage
-----

Clone the repo to your computer or visit [http://ivanistheone.github.io/ideacollector/](http://ivanistheone.github.io/ideacollector/).


Project types
-------------
 
There are three types of ideas ``this``.app can help you with.

If you have a business idea, the app will ask you questions that normally VCs will ask you.
Try to answer as quickly as possible in simple language without using buzzwords.
Remember, we are trying to get you away from the buzz and into reality.
It is not implemented yet, but in future versions, if you use buzzwords 
the app will start to make fun of you!

But perhaps your idea isn't a business---exactly---but more of a community project?
The questions below could help you think about all aspects of the project and motivate 
you to get started.

  - Community project: http://ivanistheone.github.io/ideacollector/#community


For anyone who knows a scripting language (ok ok Java/C people you are invited too),
I give you a quick questionnaire of things to think about before you start coding.

  - Technological building block: http://ivanistheone.github.io/ideacollector/#bblock


And for people writing research papers (that include poor graduate students),
a few key questions regarding the future Nobel prize contender research you are
about to publish.
